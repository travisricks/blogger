_This was built during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis._

# Connexpat

This was built during my polyglot week at Code Chrysalis. We were given one week to learn a new programming language and build a new project. I chose Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I built a blog that supports user authentication. It's currently set up to serve expats in Tokyo, but could easily be changed to support other communities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need to install the software:

- Ruby (if you have a Mac, it's already installed)
- Ruby on Rails

### Installing

After cloning the repo, install the required Gems. In the command line, run:

```bash
bundle
```

Run DB migrations

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Start the server

```bash
rails server
```

## Built With

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - The web framework used
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end component library
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Web host
- [Blog tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) - Followed this basic tutorial and then implemented additional features and custom UI styling.
